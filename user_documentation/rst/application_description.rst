Application description
***********************

MiCADO executes applications described by the Application Descriptions following the TOSCA format. This section details the structure of the application description.

Application description has four main sections:

* **tosca_definitions_version**: ``tosca_simple_yaml_1_0``.
* **imports**: a list of urls pointing to custom TOSCA types. The default url points to the custom types defined for MiCADO. Please, do not modify this url.
* **repositories**: docker repositories with their addresses.
* **topology_template**: the main part of the application description to define 1) docker services, 2) virtual machine (under the **node_templates** section) and 3) the scaling policy under the **policies** subsection. These sections will be detailed in subsections below.

Here is an overview example for the structure of the MiCADO application

Specification of Docker services
================================

Under the node_templates section you can define any number of interconnected Docker service (see **YOUR_DOCKER_SERVICE**) similarly as in a docker-compose file. Each docker service definition consists of three main parts: type, properties and artifacts. The value of the **type** keyword for a Docker service must always be ``tosca.nodes.MiCADO.Container.Application.Docker``. The **properties** section will contain most of the setting of the Docker service. Under the **artifacts** section the Docker image (see **YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE**) must be defined. Optionally, Docker networks can be defined in the same way as in a docker-compose file (see **YOUR_DOCKER_NETWORK**).

::

   topology_template:
     node_templates:
       YOUR_DOCKER_SERVICE:
         type: tosca.nodes.MiCADO.Container.Application.Docker
         properties:
            ...
         artifacts:
          image:
            type: tosca.artifacts.Deployment.Image.Container.Docker
            file: YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
            repository: docker_hub
       YOUR_DOCKER_NETWORK:
         type: tosca.nodes.MiCADO.network.Network.Docker
         properties:
           ...

The fields under the **properties** section of the Docker service are derived from the docker-compose file. Therefore, you can additional information about the properties in the `docker compose documentation <https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#service-configuration-reference>`__. The syntax of the property values is the same as in the docker-compose
file.

Under the **properties** section of a Docker service (see **YOUR_DOCKER_SERVICE**) you can specify the following keywords:

* **command**: command line expression to be executed by the container.
* **deploy**: Swarm specific deployment options.
* **entrypoint**: override the default entrypoint of container.
* **environment**: map of all required environment variables.
* **expose**: expose ports without publishing them to the host machine.
* **labels**: map of metadata like Docker labels.
* **logging**: map of the logging configuration.
* **networks**: list of connected networks for the service.
* **volumes**: list of connected volumes for the service.
* **ports**: list of published ports to the host machine.
* **secrets**: list of per-service secrets to grant access for the service.

Under the **artifacts** section you can define the docker image for the
docker service. Three fileds must be defined:

* **type**: ``tosca.artifacts.Deployment.Image.Container.Docker``
* **file**: docker image for the docker service(e.g. sztakilpds/cqueue_frontend:latest )
* **repository**: name of the repository where the image is located. The name used here (e.g. docker_hub), must be defined at the top of the description under the **repositories** section.

To define a Docker network (see **YOUR_DOCKER_NETWORK**) the following fields must be specified:

*  **attachable**: if set to true, then standalone containers can attach to this network, in addition to services
*  **driver**: specify which driver should be used for this network. (overlay, bridge, etc.)

Specification of the Virtual Machine
====================================

The network of Docker services specified in the previous section is executed under Docker Swarm. This section introduces how the parameters of the virtual machine can be configured which will be hosts the Docker worker node. During operation MiCADO will instantiate as many virtual machines with the parameters defined here as required during scaling. MiCADO currently supports four different cloud interfaces: CloudSigma, CloudBroker, EC2, Nova. The following ports and protocols should be enabled on the virtual machine:

::

   ICMP
   TCP: 22,2377,7946,8300,8301,8302,8500,8600,9100,9200
   UDP: 4789,7946,8301,8302,8600

The following subsections details how to configure them.

Description of the scaling policy
=================================

To utilize the autoscaling functionality of MiCADO, scaling policies can be defined on virtual machine and on docker service level. Scaling policies can be listed under the **policies** section. Each **scalability** subsection must have the **type** set to the value of ``tosca.policies.Scaling.MiCADO`` and must be linked to a node defined under **node_template**. The link can be implemented by specifying the name of the node under the **targets** subsection. The details of the scaling policy can be defined under the **properties** subsection. The structure of the **policies** section can be seen below.

::

   topology_template:
     node_templates:
       YOUR_DOCKER_SERVICE:
         type: tosca.nodes.MiCADO.Container.Application.Docker
         ...
       ...
       YOUR_OTHER_DOCKER_SERVICE:
         type: tosca.nodes.MiCADO.Container.Application.Docker
         ...
       YOUR_VIRTUAL_MACHINE:
         type: tosca.nodes.MiCADO.Occopus.<CLOUD_API_TYPE>.Compute
         ...

     policies:
     - scalability:
       type: tosca.policies.Scaling.MiCADO
       targets: [ YOUR_VIRTUAL_MACHINE ]
       properties:
         ...
     - scalability:
       type: tosca.policies.Scaling.MiCADO
       targets: [ YOUR_DOCKER_SERVICE ]
       properties:
         ...
     - scalability:
       type: tosca.policies.Scaling.MiCADO
       targets: [ YOUR_OTHER_DOCKER_SERVICE ]
       properties:
         ...

The scaling policies are evaluated periodically. In every turn, the virtual machine level scaling is evaluated, followed by the evaluation of each scaling policies belonging to Docker services.

The **properties** subsection defines the scaling policy itself. For monitoring purposes, MiCADO integrates the Prometheus monitoring tool with two built-in exporters on each worker node: Node exporter (to collect data on nodes) and CAdvisor (to collect data on containers). Based on Prometheus, any monitored information can be extracted using the Prometheus query language and the returned value can be associated to a user-defined variable. Once variables are updated, scaling rule is evaluated. It can be specified by a short Python code which can refer to the monitored information. The structure of the scaling policy can be seen below.

::

     - scalability:
         ...
         properties:
           sources:
             - 'myprometheus.exporter.ip.address:portnumber'
           constants:
             LOWER_THRESHOLD: 50
             UPPER_THRESHOLD: 90
             MYCONST: 'any string'
           queries:
             THELOAD: 'Prometheus query expression'
             MYEXPR: 'something refering to {{MYCONST}}'
           alerts:
             - alert: myalert
               expr: 'Prometheus expression for an event important for scaling'
               for: 1m
           min_instances: 1
           max_instances: 5
           scaling_rule: |
             if myalert:
               m_node_count=5
             if THELOAD>UPPER_THRESHOLD:
               m_node_count+=1
             if THELOAD<LOWER_THRESHOLD:
               m_node_count-=1

The subsections have the following roles:

* **sources** supports the dynamic attachment of an external exporter by specifying a list endpoints of exporters (see example above). Each item found under this subsection is configured under Prometheus to start collecting the information provided/exported by the exporters. Once done, the values of the parameters provided by the exporters become available.
* **constants** subsection is used to predefined fixed parameters. Values associated to the parameters can be referred by the scaling rule as variable (see ``LOWER_THRESHOLD`` above) or in any other sections referred as Jinja2 variable (see ``MYEXPR`` above).
* **queries** contains the list of Prometheus query expressions to be executed and their variable name associated (see ``THELOAD`` above)
* **alerts** subsection enables the utilisation of the alerting system of Prometheus. Each alert defined here is registered under Prometheus and fired alerts are represented with a variable of their name set to True during the evaluation of the scaling rule (see ``myalert`` above).
* **min_instances** keyword specifies the lowest number of instances valid for the node.
* **max_instances** keyword specifies the highest number of instances valid for the node.
* **scaling_rule** specifies Python code to be evaluated periodically to decide on the number of instances. The Python expression must be formalized with the following conditions:

  - Each constant defined under the ‘constants’ section can be referred; its value is the one defined by the user.
  - Each variable defined under the ‘queries’ section can be referred; its value is the result returned by Prometheus in response to the query string.
  - Each alert name defined under the ‘alerts’ section can be referred, its value is a logical True in case the alert is firing, False otherwise
  - Expression must follow the syntax of the Python language
  - Expression can be multiline
  - The following predefined variables can be referred; their values are defined and updated before the evaluation of the scaling rule

    - m_nodes: python list of nodes belonging to the docker swarm cluster
    - m_node_count: the target number of nodes
    - m_container_count: the target number of containers for the service the evaluation belongs to
    - m_time_since_node_count_changed: time in seconds elapsed since the number of nodes changed

  - In a scaling rule belonging to the virtual machine, the name of the variable to be updated is ``m_node_count``; as an effect the number stored in this variable will be set as target instance number for the virtual machines.
  - In a scaling rule belonging to a docker service, the name of the variable to be set is ``m_container_count``; as an effect the number stored in this variable will be set as target instance number for the docker service.

For further examples, inspect the scaling policies of the demo examples detailed in the next section.
